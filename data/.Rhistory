# Regression and model validation - analysis
*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*
- Describe your work and results clearly.
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using
*This file is the operative part of the data analysis exercises*
*for regression and model validation - analysis*
*To make all the magic happen, let's first designate the working directory*
```{r, include=FALSE}
setwd('Z:/IODS-project/data/')
```
*First we read the local data file and check its structure and*
*dimensions*
*As we've written the file as csv, we don't need to explicitly*
*state the separator and header*
```{r, include=FALSE}
rawdata <- read.csv("Z:/IODS-project/data/learning2014.csv")
```
First we inspect the structure and dimensions of the data we read from a comma-separated values file in the data directory.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(rawdata)
```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
dim(rawdata)
```
# access the GGally and ggplot2 libraries
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)
```
# Task 2
# create a more advanced plot matrix with ggpairs()
```{r}
p <- ggpairs(rawdata, mapping = aes(col = gender, alpha = 0.3), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
p
```
# Task 3
# create an plot matrix with ggpairs()
```{r}
ggpairs(rawdata, lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
```
# create a regression model with multiple explanatory variables
```{r}
my_model1 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + surf, data = rawdata)
```
```{r}
summary(my_model1)
```
```{r}
my_model1 <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra + surf, data = rawdata)
```
# Task 4
# print out a summary of the model
```{r}
summary(my_model1)
```
